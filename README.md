Hello! I'm a full stack software engineer with a deep love for all things system design. 

I enjoy analyzing systems to find opportunities for improved efficiency and simplicity. Being presented with a problem to solve I enjoy planning a solution as much as the rest of the project.

I'm always looking to improve my knowledge and skill in this area so if you'd like to chat reach out!
